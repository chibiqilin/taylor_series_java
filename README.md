## Library Details
The purpose of this repository is to create a Java library implementing standard six trigonometric functions:
1. Sine
2. Cosine
3. Tangent
4. Cosecant
5. Secant
6. Cotangent

Implementation of these trigonometric functions will be done using Taylor Series expansion.

----

## How do I use it?

1. Import the library.
2. Perform tests to validate output.

----

## JUnit Testing

JUnit testing will be used to ensure that functions are fully functional in all four quadrants. An exception must be thrown for invalid usage. For example, attempting to perform Tan(90) should throw an error of NaN as the output value is undefined.

A test suite will be integral to this assignment as it will help perform tests on all functions for extreme cases where errors can be expected.
